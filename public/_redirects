# Netlify Redirects Configuration for React SPA
# This ensures all routes are handled by React Router (BrowserRouter)
# Without this, direct URL access or page refreshes will return 404 errors

# Redirect all requests to index.html with 200 status (not 301/302 redirect)
# React Router will then handle the client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200
